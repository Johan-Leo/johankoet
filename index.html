                        My name is Johan Koet,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a 28 years old aspiring front-end developer from the Netherlands.
                        The last few years I've been discovering my creative side more and more. It's something that has
                        always been there, but somewhere in my teenage years I slowly stopped using it. A few years back
                        I discovered a little talent for drawing. I really enjoyed doing it and I thought about pursuing
                        a creative career.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started a year course in graphic design, in which I found out that I really liked making
                        illustrations in Adobe Illustrator. I did some design work, mostly for family, but something was
                        missing...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the course we also got a quick word press introduction, which peaked my interest in how
                        websites are actually made. We never touched the coding side, but it got mentioned. So after the
                        course I started to dive into (front-end) web development. Then something clicked for me: It was
                        the perfect balance between doing creative and technical work. It's like solving a creative
                        puzzle that turns into something pleasing to look at, which at the same time has to be something
                        functional.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started out learning about the CSS and HTML basics, and then I dove into JavaScript the last
                        few months. I'm a perfectionist and I always want to know exactly how things work, which makes
                        me a very thorough student. The prove of that is in a personal project that I've been working on
                        the past few months, which I will tell you all about at the bottom of this page. But first you
                        get so see a small collection of the illustrations that I've made.
